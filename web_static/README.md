# AirBnB Clone - Web Static
Hi, I'm Chernet, and this is my beginner-level project for creating a web static clone of AirBnB. The goal of this project is to design and prototype each element of the web application step-by-step by creating simple HTML static pages, a style guide, and fake content.

## HTML and CSS
I learned how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages during this project. HTML is the structure of my page, and CSS is the styling of my page. I fixed my HTML part before starting with styling because without any structure, I couldn't apply any design. I learned about the following concepts:

### Concepts
- What is HTML
- How to create an HTML page
- What is a markup language
- What is the DOM
- What is an element/tag
- What is an attribute
- How does the browser load a webpage
- What is CSS
- How to add style to an element
- What is a class
- What is a selector
- How to compute CSS specificity value
- What are box properties in CSS
### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All my files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- My code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator
- All my CSS files should be in styles folder
- All my images should be in images folder
- I'm not allowed to use !important and id (#... in the CSS file)
- I'm not allowed to use tags img, embed, and iframe
- I'm not allowed to use Javascript
- Current screenshots have been done on Chrome 56 or more.
- No cross browsers
